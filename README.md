# Data-Modeling-with-Postgres
This project arose out of the need for a startup (fictional company) to analyze the data they collect from music and user activity in their new music streaming app.

The company's data is stored in JSON files which makes it difficult to analyze via queries. So, a data modeling composed of a Postgres database and an ETL pipeline via Python was proposed, which will allow the analytics team to carry out their analysis.
