# Data-Modeling-with-Postgres
This is a project, where I applied concepts of data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project has been defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
